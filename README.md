# Problems:

1.Heavy emphasis to boiler-plate code and/or comments

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PDP is good when it comes to learning a functional language and 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;learning how to designing scalable and modular programs.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that heavy emphasis is given to boiler-plate/comments which 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may/may not be a good thing but it surely is time consuming.
