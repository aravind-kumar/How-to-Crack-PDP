# Problems:

1.Heavy emphasis to boiler-plate code and/or comments

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PDP is good when it comes to learning a functional language and learning how to designing scalable and modular programs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that heavy emphasis is given to boiler-plate/comments which may/may not be a good thing but it surely is time consuming.

2.The use of Dr-Racket as an IDE
